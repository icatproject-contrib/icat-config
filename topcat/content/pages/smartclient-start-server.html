<h1>Start Smartclient Server</h1>

<p>Topcat can't currently detect a Smartclient, this means it is not running, you haven't installed it yet or a firewall is blocking it.</p>

<p>To install Smartclient please go to the following address:</p>

<p><a href="https://icatproject.org/user-documentation/ids-smartclient/">https://icatproject.org/user-documentation/ids-smartclient/</a></p>

<p>Once the program has been started, you can then close the window as it keeps on running in the background.</p>
