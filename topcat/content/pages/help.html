<div>
    <h1 class="page-header">Logging in</h1>

    <img src="images/help/login.png" alt="Login" />

    <p>You can login by entering your username and password provided by the <a href="http://www.example.ac.uk/Users/" target="_blank">Lorum Ipsum User Office</a>. Alternatively, to view only public data, select <strong>Anonymous</strong> from the <strong>Authentication Type</strong> drop down menu and click login.</p>

    <p>Once you've successfully logged in, you will see a page with three tabs.</p>
    <img src="images/help/tabs.png" alt="Login" />
</div>

<div>
    <h1 class="page-header">My Data</h1>
    <p>The <a ui-sref="home.my-data">My Data</a> tab gives you quick access to all your visits and is presented in a grid.</p>

    <p><img src="images/help/my-data-grid.png" alt="My Data Grid" /></p>


    <h4>Meta Data</h4>

    <p>If you click on a row (make sure it is not a hyperlink), tabs will appear on the bottom half of the page. Each tab gives you more information about the visit.</p>

</div>

<div>
    <h1 class="page-header">Browse</h1>
    <p>The <a ui-sref="home.browse.facility">Browse</a> tab allows you to browse your data and any public data.</p> The grid works the same as in the My Data tab. You can sort and filter as well as drill drown the data hierarchy using the hyperlinks on each row. You can use the breadcrumb to go up the hierarchy. The breadcrumb is a useful reference to tell you where you are in the data hierarchy.</p>

    <p><img src="images/help/breadcrumb.png" alt="Breadcrumb" /></p>

    <p>If the first column of the grid is a tick box, you can click the box to add the item to your cart. Please note if you select an visit, all datasets and datafiles belonging to that visit will be selected. It is not possible for example to unselect one datafile if the parent visit is already selected.</p>

    <p>Similar to My Data, clicking on a row (not hyperlink) will display it's meta data information in the panel at the bottom of the page.</p>
</div>

<h1>Search</h1>

 <div>
     <p>The search tabs contains an interface the allows you search across all the visits, datasets and datafiles.</p>
 </div>

<h1>The Cart</h1>
<div>

    <p>On the very first column of each row on the grid, you will see tick boxes.</p>

    <p><img src="images/help/tickbox.png" alt="Tick Box" /></p>

    <p>Clicking this box will add or remove the selected visit to your <a ui-sref="home.cart">Cart</a>. Multiple items can be added using the "Shift" key.</p>

    <p>You can use the Cart items counter on the top right corner to check if an item was added or removed. 
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/help/cart-button.png" alt="Cart Items Counter" /></p>

   <p>Clicking on the above will open up the cart window:</p>

  <p><img src="images/help/cart.png" alt="Cart Window" /></p>

    <p>Here you can remove already added items or request download of the items in the cart by Clicking the <strong>Download Cart</strong> button. When the button is clicked, you will be presented with a window with several options.</p>

    <p><img src="images/help/cart-download.png" alt="Downloads Window" /></p>

    <p>The <strong>Download Name</strong> is a name that identifies your particular download. It is used as the filename when your download becomes ready.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Transport</strong> selection option determines the transport mechanism to download your files. The list of available transport mechanisms
    depends on the facility, but typical examples are:</p>

    <div>
        <table class="table table-bordered tranport-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Transport Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Additional Signup/Software</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Https</td>
                    <td>Your files are prepared so you can initiate a download via https using your browser or other tools such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">wget</a>, <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/" target="_blank">curl</a> etc. Your files will be downloaded as a compressed zip file.</td>
                    <td>None</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Globus</td>
                    <td>Your files are prepared so you can initiate a <a href="https://www.globus.org" target="_blank">Globus Online</a> download (See <a ui-sref="globus-help">Globus help</a> for more information).</td>
                    <td><p><a href="https://www.globus.org/SignUp" target="_blank">Globus Online Signup</a></p><p><a href="https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal" target="_blank">Globus Connect Personal client</a> is required</p></td>
                </tr>
                <!---
                <tr>
                    <td>Smartclient</td>
                    <td>Your files are automatically downloaded individually to your machine via the Smart client tool (<a href="https://github.com/icatproject/ids.smartclient/wiki" target="_blank">more details</a>). The Smartclient option will only appear if the Smart Client is already on you machine.</td>
                    <td><a href="https://github.com/icatproject/ids.smartclient" target="_blank">Smart Client</a> is required</td>
                </tr>
                -->
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>You can optionally enter your email address. When your download is available, an email will be sent notifying you that your download is available.</p>

    <p>Clicking the <strong>Ok</strong> button on the window will(*) submit your download request to be processed. You should see a <strong>Cart successfully submitted</strong> notification popup on the right corner. The request will be added inside the downloads window.</p>
    
    <p>(*) A particular transport mechanism may be temporarily disabled; in this case, clicking on <strong>Ok</strong> will instead produce a (red) warning message.
    You will need to choose a different transport mechanism or wait until it has been re-enabled.</p>

    <!--
    <p>If smartclient transport was selected for the request, you will see the <strong>Datafiles to retrieve</strong> counter increase in value.</p>

    <p><img src="images/help/smartclient.png" alt="Smart Client Datafiles to retrieve counter" /></p>
    -->
</div>

<div>
    <h1 class="page-header">Downloads</h1>

    <p><img src="images/help/downloads-button.png" alt="Downloads Button" /></p>

    <p>Clicking on the above will open up the downloads window:</p>

    <p>The Downloads window is a grid that list all your download requests.</p>

    <p><img src="images/help/downloads.png" alt="Downloads" /></p>

    <p>The <strong>Status</strong> column gives you the current status of your download. Possible values are <strong>Restoring from Tape</strong> and <strong>Available</strong>. The <strong>Download</strong> button is disabled when the status is restoring. Once available, you can click the download button to download the file via the browser if <strong>Https</strong> transport type was used for that request.</p>

    <p class="alert alert-info">Please note that download pausing and resuming is not supported. Multi-part download managers are also not supported.</p>

    <!--
    <p>For downloads using Smartclient as the transport type, your files are downloaded you your machine as soon as they are restored from tape archives. The complete status for smartClient downloads means all files were downloaded to your machine. Since smartclient download files individually rather than a zip archive, you can access already downloaded files in your Smart Client home directory even though the entire download has not yet completed.</p>
    -->

    <p>For downloads using Globus as the transport type, when the status is complete, you can login to <a href="https://www.globus.org/SignIn" target="_blank">Globus Online</a> and initiate file transfer to your endpoint.</p>
